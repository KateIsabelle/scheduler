# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a React app that lets users browse days of the week, view, edit, delete existing appointments, and book new appointments in empty slots. 

Visual, unit, integration, and end-to-end testing are performed through Storybook, Jest, and Cypress to achieve full testing coverage.
